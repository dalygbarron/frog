The game starts with John Fogle, Aini and Purple Hat Man parting at the entrance to a sewer in Agara. Purple Hat Man is
going to drive back to his castle, Aini is going back to Snake Parade to complete her degree in Eel Studies, and John
Fogle just needs to escape ASAP because he has the most famous face of the three, and also he doesn't have anywhere in
particular to go. The purple hat man mentions that his email is purplelegend69@cmail.com and that John can send him an
email if he needs some money or help to get started with his new life and to keep in touch etc.

Yeah so he goes through the sewers for a while which can constitute a basic tutorial, and then finally he finds a pipe
leading out which you have to jump out of. You jump out of it and then you fall into the ocean. Then there is
a cutscene of you fall into the ocean with a splash, then eventually showing you floating in the ocean, and some boat
stopping by and finding you. We can make the cutscene nice but anyway, after a while you wake up surrounded by a few
people on their boat.

They are swamp people I guess but these particular ones live in a kind of convoy of boats tied together in the ocean,
and they drift about the joint. You might do a few more tutorial bits while on these people's boats and have your first
bullet hell moment with them, but after that is done, they drop you off at bagoon.

It is a nice joint but you can't really do a whole lot initially because you have got no money and you are living in a
tent. However, you can go to the library and use the computer. Also, if you talk to people who have good advice, they
will say "you already smell like fish, you ought to buy a boat and become a professional fisherman or sea courier".
Also, one of the shops where you currently cannot afford anything is the boat dealership, which is selling off an old
piece of junk for $500. You need to email the purple hat man and ask him for $500 so that you can buy the boat.

So emails are the way that you swap to what different characters are doing, so when you email the purple hat man it
switches to playing as him. He receives the email at his computer and he is going to reply, but then the power at his
castle goes out so he has to go and investigate. I will flesh out what happens to purple hat man at his castle more
elsewhere but he will have a storyline that culimates in the events of purple castle and his castle will be destroyed
and he will have to leave and thus will then bump into John Fogle. Yeah so he gets his computer working and sends John
$500 which allows him to buy the boat and start having fun. He also says he sent your email address to Aini, but she
doesn't email until you have driven in your boat because getting your boat money then immediately switching characters
would suck.

Then at the mouth of the harbor you also find that there is some kind of monster which has been blocking people from
leaving. This is just an excuse to do your first bullet hell mostly.

Ok that is the start of the game. Beyond this point you can basically do whatever you like.

===========

So what I initially want to do is get the game engine useful enough that it can implement everything stated here. Once
I have done that I am gonna release the initial build. So in order to do that, what do we need to do to the engine?
 - need to be able to make walls transparent if they are in front of you. Actually, if we need a hack, what we could do
   is just make the interior wall block model things one sided so that you can see through them from the back. The only
   issue is furniture and stuff will still be in the way, but this might be good enough so try it first. Also, we can
   do the same thing with many furniture items assuming we can rotate them.
 - Bullet hell
 - Boat driving and basics of overworld (day/night cycle, tides)
 - swapping between characters with different inventories etc.
 - saving and loading.
 - Fishing from land and boat.

So with fishing what we will ahve is that every island will be given a different type of geographical classification
such as reef, sandy island, rock island, man made. Hmm man made might fall under reef. Anyway when you fish near such
places that helps to determine what kinds of fish will appear, as the current depth of the sea floor. Actually, the
depth of the sea floor will be determined purely by distance from water features, so large flat areas will be created
by a proliferation of minor features like trees.

The depth of the sea floor is determined by the slope down from the nearest island.

Spawning events will also randomly occur in different parts of the ocean which is where schools of fish start jumping
to the surface which causes a higher chance of getting large predator fish.

Maybe you will be able to set a hook size so you don't get small fish when you want large fish but I dunno.

Bream, whiting -> caught in shallow places near man made structures.
Crab, Octopus -> caught in shallow places with very low depth variance.
Snapper, Pearl Perch, Rock Cod -> caught around reefs.
Mackerel, Tuna -> caught in deep waters.

After I have finished the basics I might include things like bait and hook customisation.

I can also generate (for dev, not for players) heatmaps for each type of fish showing where they are most likely to be
caught as a way of debugging that my logic for where to catch them is working correctly. Only painful thing is that we
have to take multiple samples per place to detect variance in the depth so the number of samples is gonna be high. At
least I can make it go at less than one pixel per meter. Maybe I can have an oversampling mode so you can do 1 pixel
= 5 square meters, but it shows the average of 5 samples (as opposed to 25) taken from within the area for each pixel.
