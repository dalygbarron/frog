Yeah this is what it is, not much unusual about it.

Bullets will be rendered without nodes and collisions will be done first at bounding box level, then at perfect circle
level. However, the bounding box level is gonna exclude 100% of bullets except when you are being shot or very almost
shot, so who cares.

You will enter the bullet screen via a nice black transition covering the screen, and when it goes away, it will have
switched to bullet mode which will add black bars on either side of the screen for where you cannot go rather than
having any ui on the sides of the screen, there will be nothing instead and your lives and stuff will appear within the
battle area. The bad dudes will have a health circle thing like they did in spider engine or whatever it was called.
